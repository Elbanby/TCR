### About 
TCR is a web application that we built in 36 hours for Toronto Cat Rescue. TCR web application was an attempt to solve TCR internal operassion issue. TCR struggled with manual data entery, unstructured data flying around, lots of paper work, lack of tracking tools. Hence, few cats might get lost on the System, or the volunteers have to do way more effort to be able to get a cat a home. 

Our TCR web application have solved all of that here is how: 
---
We have built a centralized System, where there are two end points. A web page for all the Shelters to register a cat on the System. The System stores it on cloud database that can scale, and the TCR employees get an instant email that a cat needs help. The other end point is for the Voulnteers to use, where it gets updated in real time if a cat is added to the System. This end point is where TCR voulnteers can see the status of the cat and all the cat informassion.
